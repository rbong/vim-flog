INTRODUCTION                                    *flog*

Flog is a lightweight branch viewer for vim. Flog provides a wrapper to "git
log --graph" that can be run from any git repository. It provides several
helpful commands and bindings to interact with the graph. Flog integrates with
|fugitive|. See "git log --help" and |fugitive| for more details.

COMMANDS                                        *flog-commands*

                                                *flog-:Flog*
:Flog

  Open the log graph in a new tab. This command can be run from any file in a
  git repository. Any |fugitive-commands| can be run from the buffer. The
  following options are supported:

  -all                  Enable the "--all" argument by default.
  -bisect               Enable the "--bisect" argument by default.
  -open-cmd=<cmd>       The command to use to open the window containing the
                        graph. Must give initial focus to the window. Defaults
                        to |tabedit|.
  -format=<format>      A format specifier to pass to "--pretty=format:".
                        Multiline formats are supported.
  -rev=<rev>            The git revision to pass to the log command.
  -path=<path>          A path to pass to the log command. This option can be
                        specified multiple times for multiple paths.
  -raw-args=<args>      Additional args to pass to "git log --graph". No args
                        passed in using this option are guaranteed to work.

:Flogsplit                                      *flog-:Flogsplit*

  Open the log graph in a split. Supports |<mods>|. Behaves the same as
  |:Flog| otherwise.

:Flogsplitcommit                                *flog-:Flogsplitcommit*

  Open a commit under the cursor using |:Gsplit| in a |flog-preview-window|.
  Can only be run in the |:Flog| window.

:Floggit                                        *flog-:Floggit*

  Open a git command via |:Git|.

  File completion is available from this command, as well as completion for
  the commits and refs under the cursor. Completion applies to the first and
  last lines of the currently or previously selected range if the cursor is on
  the first or last line of the range. Completion is also available for the
  "commit range" (not to be confused with the visual selection range, ex.
  "COMMIT1..COMMIT2").

  This command can only be run in the |:Flog| window.

:Floggit!                                       *flog-:Floggit*

  Same as |:Floggit|, but opens the git command in a preview window. Supports
  modifiers.

MAPPINGS                                        *flog-mappings*

All mappings are available only from the |:Flog| window.

PREVIEW WINDOWS                                 *flog-preview-window*

windows. Flog preview windows will be closed when quitting Flog.
